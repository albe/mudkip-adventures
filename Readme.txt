1. So, I herd u liek Mudkip?!

This game is made around the Pokemon character Mudkip, a water-type Pokemon.
You play Mudkip and your aim is to keep other wild Pokemon away from their
target (which oddly enough is your food you collected).
You can use your attacks and also to some degree block the enemies way to
keep them away from your precious berries.
At the start you will only have a tackle attack type, which allows you to deal
some damage and at the same time move back the enemies (and maybe even in chain).
As you earn experience, you will learn other attacks that are more powerful but
also might just work well in combination with tackle (for example, the bubble
attack).
If one of the wild Pokemon catched one of your berries, you are still able
to get it back, if you either hurt the enemy with tackle or watergun, or if
you knocked out the enemy completely before it can escape.
