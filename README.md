## 1. So, I herd u liek Mudkip?!

This game is made around the Pokemon character Mudkip, a water-type Pokemon.
You play Mudkip and your aim is to keep other wild Pokemon away from their
target (which oddly enough is your food you collected).
You can use your attacks and also to some degree block the enemies way to
keep them away from your precious berries.
At the start you will only have a tackle attack type, which allows you to deal
some damage and at the same time move back the enemies (and maybe even in chain).
As you earn experience, you will learn other attacks that are more powerful but
also might just work well in combination with tackle (for example, the bubble
attack).
If one of the wild Pokemon caught one of your berries, you are still able
to get it back, if you either hurt the enemy with tackle or watergun, or if
you knocked out the enemy completely before it can escape.



## 2. Status

**Lv**      - The level you are at. Possible range 1 - 99. For every level you gain more
              strength, healt points and aqua points and regenerate aqua points faster.

**HP**      - Health points. How many damage you can take.

**AP**      - Aqua points. How many water you have available to use for water-type attacks.

**Berries** - How many berries you still have. Game is over if you have no berries and
          all Pokemon carrying one have escaped.



## 3. Attacks

**X:**   Bubble - Deal little damage. 33% chance to 'freeze' the enemy for some time. Uses few aqua points.

Only one attack made it into the compo version, due to an very ugly next-to-intractable bug that started
to occur 5 hours before deadline and kept me busy instead of implementing the last attacks.
Later versions will contain more attacks to make the game more fun.


## 4. Known Bugs

- Sometimes the Pokemon just disappear when they caught a berry
- Sometimes the Pokemon get stuck at places
